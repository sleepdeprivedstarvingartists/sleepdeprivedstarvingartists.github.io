<div class="midleftcolumn"> <p> Brooklyn is the borough of New York City with the largest population. It takes up the western end of Long Island and is across the East River from Manhattan Island. <p>

People from Brooklyn are way cool and they do not sound like they come from New Jersey. Like whaddayatalkin? New Jersey? <p>

I wouldn’t wish on my worst enemy that he would have to say that he came from New Jersey. I mean, are you kiddin’ me? Just remember, New Jersey is not Brooklyn. And neither is the Bronz. <p>

There are all sorts of neighborhoods in Brooklyn. Now that Manhattan is too expensive for mere human beings to be able to afford to rent an apartment, everyone is moving to Brooklyn and that’s become too expensive. <p>

After all, the alternative would be New Jersey and nobody wants that.

This is a sidebar. A sidebar is a short piece that supplements the main article. <p>

It may be some specific point of interest or elaboration on something in your main article. <p>

If your article is about a restaurant, the sidebar could be location, hours, and menu prices. <p>

But whatever else, a sidebar is short. <p>
